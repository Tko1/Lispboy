** TODO Decide how and where to organize spec?
** TODO Decide whether or not to spec so much
   (example being; specing the variables in a let statement, is this too much?)
** TODO Decide whether or not to consider this a good candidate for experimentation
   In which case, as I typically have begun to do for 'experimentations of
   balance' like this, where we hope to find the sweet spot for something, or at
   the very least gain intuition on what complexities are being affected when
   you add or remove some thing ( specs, in this case ),I will possibly try to go
   to the extremes of specing everything, and not specing at all.
